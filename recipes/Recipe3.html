        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook Sushi Rice: Best salmon nigiri starts with high-quality sushi rice. Japanese short-grain sushi rice
                works the best. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and let it cool down slightly. When
                it’s still very warm, season with sushi vinegar (or white vinegar, sugar and salt).</li>
            <li>Slice the Salmon: Cut the salmon against the grain, with about 30 to 45 degree angle. You’ll need to
                adjust the angle from time to time to get the proper length and thickness. I recommend cutting it to
                3-inch long, 1-inch wide, and 1/4-inch thick pieces.</li>
            <li>Shape the Rice: Take about 3 tablespoons of rice in your right hand. Squeeze it together until it rolls
                into a firm oval shape. Try to make the bottom flat with a rounded top.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Nigiri: Place the rolled sushi rice onto the salmon, and bend your fingers to cover both
                the fish and rice together. Press down the rice using the index finger from the other hand.</li>
            <li>Arrange and Serve: Turn the fish and rice and let the salmon slice sit on top of the rice. Arrange them
                on a plate and serve with optional wasabi, soy sauce, along with pickled ginger.</li>
        </ol>
